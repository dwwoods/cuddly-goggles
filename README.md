## Learning Go in public. 

Building a small API will teach you the fundamentals and give you a practical, job-ready skill.

This is from a Reddit post which I'll credit later, Suggesting most Go jobs interviews require an API example. 

## Abstract
Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled language designed at Google. It's known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming, which makes it fantastic for building backend services.

Let's map out a path to get you from beginner to deploying your first Go microservice.

## Here's our learning plan:
Go Language Fundamentals: We'll start with the absolute basics, like setting up your environment, variables, loops, and functions.
Composite Data Types in Go: We'll cover how Go groups data using arrays, slices, maps, and structs. Structs will be super important for defining our API's data models.
Building a Basic API Service: This is where the fun begins! We'll use Go's standard library to build a simple web server with a couple of endpoints.
Testing Your Application: We'll write some unit tests to make sure our API works as expected.
Containerizing with Docker: We'll learn how to package our application into a Docker container so it can run anywhere.
Next Steps: Finally, we'll touch on the more advanced topics mentioned in the post, like logging and metrics.
By the end, you'll have a solid foundation in Go and a working project that you can build upon.
